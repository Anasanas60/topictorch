# TopicTorch 🔥

> Scan your study notes, get AI-generated Q&A, and find the perfect tutorials—all in your browser.
## About The Project

TopicTorch is an AI-powered study assistant designed to transform static study materials (images or PDFs of notes) into an interactive learning experience. The app uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to digitize text, and then leverages Google's Gemini AI to generate relevant study questions, provide detailed answers, and curate a list of high-quality YouTube tutorials tailored to the document's content.

This project was built to be fast, private, and free to use. All OCR and file processing happens directly in the browser, and the AI features are powered by a secure, serverless backend.

## Key Features

*   📄 **Advanced OCR for Images & PDFs:** Upload images or multi-page PDFs. The app automatically detects whether a PDF is digital (extracts text instantly) or scanned (renders pages and runs them through OCR).
*   🤖 **Gemini-Powered QnA Studio:**
    *   **Generate Questions:** Automatically create a list of relevant, exam-style questions based on your notes.
    *   **Get Answers:** Select questions and get detailed, formatted answers generated by Gemini.
    *   **Web Fallback:** Optionally allow the AI to search the web if your notes don't contain the answer.
*   📺 **AI-Curated YouTube Tutorials:** Instead of basic keyword search, TopicTorch uses Gemini to generate smart, contextual search queries based on your notes, ensuring highly relevant video recommendations.
*   ✨ **Interactive UI:**
    *   **Bookmark Tutorials:** Save your favorite videos to a personal "My Saved Tutorials" list.
    *   **Language Options:** Supports both English and Bengali OCR, and allows users to select their preferred language for tutorial results.
    *   **Dark/Light Mode:** Toggle between themes with automatic persistence.
    *   **Search & Filter:** Search within your OCR text to quickly find specific content.
    *   **Text Statistics:** View character, word, and line counts for your extracted text.
*   💾 **Auto-Save & Persistence:** Your OCR text, questions, answers, and bookmarks are automatically saved and restored when you return.
*   📤 **Export Your Study Pack:** Download your full Q&A session as a professionally formatted `.docx` file for offline study.
*   🧹 **Clear All:** Reset your session with a single click (with confirmation to prevent accidents).

## How To Run Locally

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or higher)
*   npm

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Anasanas60/topictorch.git
    cd topictorch
    ```

2.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    *   **For the Frontend (Vite):** Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of the project and add your YouTube API Key.
        ```
        VITE_YT_API_KEY=AIza...
        ```
    *   **For the Backend (Vercel Functions):** You will need to set your Gemini API Key in the terminal session where you run the dev server.
        *   On Windows (PowerShell):
            ```powershell
            $env:GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
            ```
        *   On macOS/Linux:
            ```bash
            export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
            ```

4.  **Run the development servers:**
    You need to run two servers at the same time in two separate terminals.
    *   **Terminal 1 (Vercel Functions):**
        ```bash
        npx vercel dev
        ```
        *(This will run your backend at `http://localhost:3000`)*

    *   **Terminal 2 (Frontend UI):**
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
        *(This will run your UI at `http://localhost:5173`)*

5.  **Open the app:** Go to `http://localhost:5173` in your browser. The app is configured to automatically call the backend on port 3000.
